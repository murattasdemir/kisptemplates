  abstract = {Abstract We estimate the union premium for young men over a period of declining unionization (1980–87) through a procedure which identifies the alternative sources of the endogeneity of union status. While we estimate the average increase in wages resulting from union employment to be in excess of 20\% we find that the return to unobserved heterogeneity operating through union status is substantial and that the union premium is highly variable. We also find that the premium is sensitive to the form of sorting allowed in estimation. Moreover, the data are consistent with comparative advantage sorting. Our results suggest that the unobserved heterogeneity which positively contributes to the likelihood of union membership is associated with higher wages. We are unable, however, to determine whether this is due to the ability of these workers to extract monopoly rents or whether it reflects the more demanding hiring standards of employers faced by union wages. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	We explore the role of one such traditional institution—the caste

	data on school enrollment and income over the past 20 years. We find
	that male working-class—lower-caste—networks continue to channel
	boys into local language schools that lead to the traditional occupation,
	despite the fact that returns to nontraditional white-collar occupations
	rose substantially in the 1990s, suggesting the possibility of a
	dynamic inefficiency. In contrast, lower-caste girls, who historically
	had low labor market participation rates and so did not benefit from
	the network, are taking full advantage of the opportunities that
	became available in the new economy by switching rapidly to English
	schools. (JEL I21, J16, O15, Z13)},

	quantify the effects of English-speaking ability on wages. We find
	that being fluent in English (compared to not speaking any English)
	increases hourly wages of men by 34\%, which is as much as the return
	to completing secondary school and half as much as the return to
	completing a Bachelor’s degree. Being able to speak a little English
	significantly increases male hourly wages 13\%. There is considerable
	heterogeneity in returns to English. More experienced and more educated
	workers receive higher returns to English. The complementarity between
	English skills and education appears to have strengthened over time.

	most of this convergence is explained by factors other than language

	as a foreign language but also some subjects (at least Science, History
	and Geography) are taught in English. Spanish and Mathematics are

	finished Primary education in June 2010 and they took the standardized
	test for all 6th grade students in Madrid on the skills considered
	\&quot;indispensable\&quot; at that age. This test is our measure

	to face a double self-selection problem. One is caused by schools
	who decide to apply for the program, and a second one caused by students
	when choosing school. We take several routes to control for these
	selection problems. The main route to control for self-selected schools
	is to take advantage of the test being conducted in the same schools
	before and after the program was implemented in 6th grade. To control
	for students self-selection we combine the use of several observable
	characteristics (like parents' education and occupation) with the
	fact that most students were already enrolled at the different schools
	before the program was announced. Our results indicate that there
